                    relationship).

                    person must make an initial registration via an Imperial Trade Ltd website’s registration form, or directly
                    through
                    their Trader`s Room and agree with the terms listed in the given Privacy Policy. The Client confirms acceptance
                    of these
                    terms by ticking the corresponding box on the registration form. If such consent is not given, Imperial Trade
                    Plc cannot
                    process a persons’ data, nor provide any services to the person in question.

                <li>
                    Attending courses and participating in campaigns - The client’s data will be processed when registering for the
                    offered
                    webinars or seminars, or when landing on any of Imperial Trade Ltd’ campaign pages that require registration –
                    as
                    Imperial Trade Ltd will need to use a client’s personal information to perform its services and comply with its
                    obligations. In all such cases, a client’s consent for data processing will be gathered through the registration
                    form
                    that they use to sign up, which subsequently creates login credentials for access to the Trader`s Room.
                </li>
            
                <li>
                    Cancellation of the initial registration - When a person cancels the registration process and does not complete
                    it, that
                    person ‘s data will not be retrieved by Imperial Trade Ltd and will, therefore, not be saved for further
                    processing in
                    the future.
                </li>
            
                <li>
                    Declining the option to be contacted via phone - A person always has the right torequest not to be contacted via
                    telephone by an Imperial Trade Ltd representative. This request will be saved within Imperial Trade Ltd’
                    internal
                    systems and acts as a separate restriction which Imperial Trade Ltd will, of course, be respected. The request
                    to not to
                    be contacted via telephone does not affect a client from using Admiral Market’s services. Additionally, this
                    does not
                    restrict said person to contact Imperial Trade Ltd by their own initiative.
                </li>

                    It’s also possible to unsubscribe from these marketing emails by clicking the link within the emails that have

                    interests to

                    Imperial Trade Ltd shall implement adequate and sufficient measures to ensure that every data processing
                    operation
                    leaves a trace, which would afterwards enable identification of the person who performed the operation, the
                    nature and
                    time of the operation and any other relevant facts, including when, by whom and which data were recorded,
                    altered or
                    deleted, or when, by whom and which data in the data processing system were accessed, as well as information on
                    any
                    transmission of data. A possibility for restoring the content of the data before modifications shall be
                    available when
                    any modifications are made to the data or documents.

                    The personal information that the client provides in connection with registering itself as a user in the
                    Trader`s Room
                    is classified as registered Information. Registered Information is protected in many ways. Clients can access
                    the
                    Trader`s Room with their username (client email) and password selected by the client. It is the clients’
                    responsibility
                    to ensure that the login and password is known only to the client itself.

                    Transmission of information via regular email exchange is not always completely secure. Imperial Trade Ltd
                    however
                    exercises all endeavors to protect clients’ personal data, yet it cannot guarantee the security of client data
                    that is
                    transmitted via email; any transmission is at the clients’ own risk. Once Imperial Trade Ltd has received the
                    client
                    information it will use procedures and security features in an attempt to prevent unauthorised access.

                    cases it is transferred to and processed in countries outside the EU/EEA. This exception applies with client
                    data held
                    under Imperial Trade Ltd PTY Ltd. (the investment firm operating in Australia), which is processed by an
